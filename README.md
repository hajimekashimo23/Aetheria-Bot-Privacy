Aetheria Bot Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 2025

Thank you for using Aetheria, a multifunctional Discord bot developed for entertainment, creativity, and utility.

🧠 1. Information We Collect

Aetheria only collects minimal data necessary for its features:

User IDs and usernames (for profile and economy systems)

Server IDs (to manage per-server configurations)

XP, tokens, and custom progress data

Command usage logs (for debugging in developer mode)

Aetheria does not store message contents or private user information.

🔒 2. How We Use Your Data

Collected data is used only to:

Save your in-bot progress (levels, tokens, etc.)

Provide user-specific features (e.g., economy rewards)

Debug or improve the bot’s performance

Data is never sold, shared, or used for advertising.

🧹 3. Data Removal

You may request full deletion of your data by contacting the developer via Discord:

All related data will be erased permanently.

🌐 4. External APIs

Aetheria uses OpenAI API and Discord API for its features.
These services may temporarily process input data to generate responses, but Aetheria does not store those responses after use.

🧩 5. Changes

This policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the bot after updates means you agree to the revised terms.
